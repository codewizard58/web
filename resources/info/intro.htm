    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This web page was inspired by the Littlebits hardware modules that snap together magnetically. The "snaps" are either an input or an output. 
        Using the magnetic North and South poles
        the magnets are arranged in the snaps so that an input and an output will attract each other and that two inputs or two outputs will repel.
        Each snap also has three electrical contacts. 
        <ul><li>+5 Volt power</li><li>Data (which is a value between 0 and +5 volts)</li><li>0 Volt power and the common for the data value</li></ul>
        A Power bit has just an output and is used to power the rest of the chain of bits. The data signal of the power bit is +5 volt.

    <p>I first discovered the Littlebits modules at Moogfest in 2014. Korg had designed a series of bits based on their synthesizer designs. </p>
    <p>A couple of years later, I thought about making a web page that used the simple snap together idea modules with a single data line between modules.
        And coded the basic module with snaps design. The code had to allow the snapping of modules together and building up groups of modules.
